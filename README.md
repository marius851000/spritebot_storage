# SpriteBot reader/writer

It can read and write the SpriteBot format used by SpriteCollab.

There are still some things missing required for a 1.0.0 release:

- Support the CopyOf field (at least reading)
- Testing on all SpriteCollab and NotSpriteCollab sprites
- At least a unit test that try to read and to write a sprite file
